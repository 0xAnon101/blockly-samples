<p>The minimum code needed to define a new renderer:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Define a renderer that extends the base renderer: <code>CustomRenderer</code></li>
  <li>Register the renderer by name: <code>'custom_renderer'</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The resulting renderer looks like the base renderer.</p>

<p>Note that this renderer looks unfinished when compared to Geras.  Some areas have too much padding, and others have too little.</p>

<p>You can extend any of the built-in renderers by changing line 7 to refer to the desired renderer.</p>
